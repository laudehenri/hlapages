### Context

Present the current situation and the scope of the Project :

-   Existing affected processes
-   Affected parties (actors and structures)
-   Affected products
-   Affected information system

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition and objectives
-------------------------

Describe the objective(s) to reach with the implementation of the
Project

Try to present numbers, e.g.: save 30 days for this process, gain 10% of
productivity, etc.

One or several scenarios for the project
----------------------------------------

Detail the possible scenario(s), each one with the following elements:

-   a macro timetable
-   an estimation of the costs to incur (during the running of the
    project) and the profits to make (during the 5 years following the
    end of the Project)
-   a description of the risks associated with the running of the
    Project
-   a description of main architectural items and criteria of the
    scenario

Available resources : human, material

Indicate the preferred scenario, and why, with a proposition for the
composition of the Project Team.

Project path
------------

Description of the facts that the project leaders, product owner, the
scrum master and architects should be aware of (and should take into
account ) including:

-   Project Approach : Describe the development method, e.g. package
    integration, stand alone product, external development, internal
    development, along with details as to how it will integrate into any
    existing systems, if relevant.

-   Outline Project Deliverables and/or Desired Outcomes :confirm all
    the deliverables from the project. Be as explicit as possible and
    remember to include things like updated documentation, amended
    operational procedures, new/amended functionality, new/upgraded
    hardware, decommissioned hardware/applications etc.

-   Exclusions : Anything listed in this section is NOT part of the
    project scope and MUST NOT be taken into account when planning the
    work and estimating costs, project duration etc.

-   Constraints : A constraint is a restriction that will affect the
    performance of the project, e.g. a pre-defined budget. List any
    constraints here which have had (or may have) an impact on any
    aspect of the project definition or the ability to deliver. For
    example, it may not be possible to do full end to end testing or the
    scope of the project may have to be limited in order to meet an
    external deadline. Other examples could be: limited budget, limited
    resource availability.

-   Dependencies / Areas Affected: all interfaces that the project has.
    These are not technical system interfaces, but organisational or
    business process interfaces.

-   Assumptions : all assumptions that have been made during the scoping
    and definition of the project and the drafting of this PMP. For
    example, you may have assumed that budget will have been made
    available by a certain time, that resources will be available on the
    requested date, etc.

-   References: list all documents that were used in developing your
    plan.

Expected Profits
----------------

The profits can be made in several domains:

-   Productivity: estimated workload in man days and translation in $
-   Systems: saved time to process the system
-   Materials: savings in supplies and (external) services
-   Clients / time: Perception of improvement of the service by the
    client (delivery period, web tools, quality of information, loyalty)
-   Products / sales: increase the market share, improve the sales tools
    and save time for the commercial people …

Plan and budget the IT subproject
---------------------------------

Plan your IT project, use a V or a W life cycle project and integrate
the agility principles and technics using a SCRUM-like framework, at
least in the building stages.

In the case of you want to perform an outstanding project, put in place
agile processes **from Realisation phases to roll-out (and support)** in
order to success and apply **modern Devops and CI/CD practices**.

In any case, ensure that your test process is at the state of the art
and alternate verification and validation testing stages around the
technical stages :

-   **Verification** is the evaluation of whether or not a product,
    service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement,
    specification, or imposed condition. It is often an **internal
    process**. Contrast with validation.
-   **Validation** is he assurance that a product, service, or system
    meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders.
    It often involves acceptance and suitability with **external**
    customers or end users (the product owner is not an standard end
    user). Contrast with verification.

Risk Management
---------------

A brief description of the risk management tasks to be performed during
the project. You should describe the following:

-   The approach to be used to identify risks, and how the risk list
    will be analyzed and prioritized.
-   The risk management strategies that will be used, including
    mitigation, avoidance, and/or prevention strategies for the most
    significant (“Top 10”) risks.
-   How the status of each significant risk and its mitigation
    activities will be monitored.
-   Risk review and reporting schedules. A risk review should be part of
    each iteration or phase acceptance review!

Project Quality
---------------

List of applicable quality standards for the project. The purpose of
this section is to identify how the project will meet those standards
completed with that we name “state of the art”.

The main topics are:

-   Quality Control : Quality control is monitoring specific project
    results to determine whether they comply with the relevant quality
    standards. This is those activities which the project team undertake
    to ensure the quality of deliverables. Identify what quality control
    activities will occur during the project, who will be responsible
    for them and what deliverables they will produce. For example: peer
    reviews, testing.

-   Architecture, Security and Data Integrity: List the activities
    intended to ensure that the project meets all architecture, security
    and data standards.

-   Quality Assurance: Quality Assurance are those activities which
    check that the project is employing the processes needed to meet
    requirements. Typically it is performed by someone external to the
    project to ensure independence and objectivity. Identify the project
    quality assurance activities, who will be responsible for them and
    the deliverables they will produce. For example: quality reviews,
    process measurements.

You should have a clear PDCA cycle to ensure the quality of the project:

-   Plan : plan the project INCLUDING quality tasks
-   Do : do it!
-   Check : check and measure the gaps
-   Act : put in place the mitigation, update your processes …
-   … new PDCA loop

### Checklist / audit plan

How to build the quality review plan:

-   Review and Audit Tasks: Describe briefly each type of review and
    audit that will be carried out on the project. For each type,
    identify the project artifacts that will be the subject of the
    review or audit. These may include Joint Customer and Developer
    Technical and Management Reviews, Process Reviews and Audits,
    Customer Audits, and Internal Technical and Management Reviews.
-   Schedule: Detail the schedule for the reviews and audits. This
    includes reviews and audits scheduled at project milestones, as well
    as reviews that are triggered by delivery of project artifacts. This
    subsection may reference the project or iteration plan.
-   Organization and Responsibilities : List the specific groups or
    individuals involved in each of the identified review and audit
    activities. Describe briefly the tasks and responsibilities of each.
    Also, list any external agencies that are expected to approve or
    regulate any product of the project.
-   Problem Resolution and Corrective Action:This subsection describes
    the procedures for reporting and handling problems identified during
    project reviews and audits. The Problem Resolution Plan may be
    referenced.
-   Tools, Techniques, and Methodologies: Describe any specific tools,
    techniques or methodologies that will be used to carry out the
    review and audit activities identified in this plan. You should
    describe the explicit process to be followed for each type of review
    or audit. Your organization may have a standard Review and Audit
    Procedures Manual, which may be referenced. These procedure
    descriptions should also address the collection, storage, and
    archiving of the project’s Review Records.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Communication Plan
------------------

The communication plan on the project is set to ascertain that the
stakeholders understands the objectives of the project and then accept
the disruptions and troubles that could happen in their day-to-day
organisation due to the project.

Main topics (focus to the project communication):

-   Define the communication needs according to target public
-   Plan the communication actions with the aim of conveying the vision
    of the project and its orientations , of clarifying the reporting
    structure , etc.
-   Ensure the project reference information is easily accessible to all
    the teams
-   Ensure the communication is efficient

The different communication targets to be taken into account in a
project/maintenance are often:

-   Vision and Orientations of the Project/Maintenance
-   Meetings with the project/maintenance team
-   Committees with the Main sponsors
-   Meetings with stake holders (subcontractors, suppliers,
    contributors, etc.)
-   institutional reporting

It is important to answer the following questions in order to establish
the communication plan, to detail the characteristics of each
communication considered:

-   WHO who is this communication aiming, who is its target population?
-   WHAT what is the content of the communication?
-   HOW what are the media that need to be used?
-   WHEN when, how often, upon event?

GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE
===================

This Global Architecture provides an architectural overview of the
solution, depicting its different aspects using different views. It is
intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions
made.

The GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE provides a comprehensive overview of the
architecture of the solution. It is a communication medium between the
sponsor and the architects regarding significant points of the project.
The GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE is an input to an architecture review process.

Tailoring the GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------------

The outline of the GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE may be adjusted to suit the
nature of the project. Some of the sections may be irrelevant or
shortened. Some specific aspects may require their own supplemental
section. Some appendices have to be added to explain certain aspects.
List and justify here the tailoring decisions you have taken. Otherwise,
delete this paragraph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business architecture
---------------------

Purpose: to recall the business context, scope and processes of the
solution:

### Introduction

Answer the following questions:

-   From a business model point of view, what are the business changes
    supported by the project? In which ways, does it change?
-   Is it compliant with the YOUR ORGANIZATION's Business Strategy?
-   What are the links with the YOUR ORGANIZATION's business? Is it a
    strategic project for the business? Why?
-   Are there impacts on the organization and its procedures? What are
    they?
-   If it is a project for a product, what are the product families,
    product types, product management modes and risks types, the
    distribution channels, and the marketing targets?

The business architecture is described by broken down and orchestrated
business processes and activities which are triggered by and generate
business events. Those processes and activities operate in a human,
organizational, and technical context that has to be delineated.

### Business context

List all the human, organizational or technical (e.g. IT systems,
applications, devices) entities and stakeholders involved in the
business solution (the “In-Scope Stakeholders”).

| **Name**         | **Definition**         |
|------------------|------------------------|
| stakeholder name | stakeholder definition |

You may formalize the business context of the solution, using a
top-level flow diagram: the business solution symbol is connected with
external entity symbols formalizing the In-Scope Stakeholders around.
Besides formalizing the context, this top-level flow diagram shows
external exchanges. It formalizes the information flows between the
business solution and In-Scope Stakeholders.

Alternatively, you may formalize the business context using a top-level
UML business use case diagram. The business solution is denoted by a
single business use case symbol. All In-Scope Stakeholders are denoted
by business actors. (Recall that business actors do not denote only
human beings, but any kind of external entities, organizations for
instance.). The exchanges may be denoted as information flows between
the business solution and the In-Scope Stakeholders. They may also be
formalized in UML communication or collaboration diagrams.

### Business processes

List the broken down business macro-processes, processes and activities
involved in the business solution (the “In-Scope Processes”) grouped by
owning processes.

| **Owning Process/Activities** | **Name**              | **Definition**              |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| process/activity              | process/activity name | process/activity definition |

You may present this list in hierarchical process diagrams using process
symbols.

Alternatively, business processes and activities may be described with
the use case technique, and/or

using UML activity diagrams.

### Business events

The In-Scope Stakeholders and Processes communicate through triggering
business events. List the business events exchanged between In-Scope
Stakeholders and Processes (“In-Scope Events”).

Purpose: to describe the high level functions, services or use cases of
the solution.

### Functional/services composition

Identify and describe the high-level nested functional blocks or
high-level use cases of the solution that support the in-scope business
processes/activities. You may formalize these functional blocks using
UML package diagrams, and the use cases in use case diagrams.

Trace the business architecture to the functional architecture. Which
functional blocks support each in-scope business process/activity?

### Data model or semantic model (ontology)

Identify and describe the conceptual entities of the domain of the
solution, and their relations. You may formalize this using high-level
simplified UML class diagrams. If there are different subject matters or
domains in the solution, each one has a separate data model. If there
are few entities and relations, provide their description here,
otherwise in Appendix.

Domain entities:

| **Name**    | **Description**    |

and behavior (object lifecycles, operations).

### Application composition

Identify and describe the logical modules that support the functional
architecture required and make up the solution . Each logical module is
an isolated subject matter that the solution needs to integrate. Each
one has a mission statement . It can be already realized or not . You
may illustrate the application architecture of the solution and its
layered logical architecture in an UML package diagram.

Logical modules:

|             |                   |                  |                    |     |

Questions that can help you to identify the logical modules of the
solution:

-   Is the solution based on (a) commercial package(s)? Which one(s)?
-   Is the solution based on micro-services, API (reuse or to be
    developed from scratch, mutualized or not, with a clear Service
    Level Agreeement or not) ?
-   Are there logical modules that must be developed from scratch?
-   Are there logical modules that can be reused?
-   Does the solution need to exchange data (or services) with other
    applications? If yes, does it use an existing exchange
    infrastructure (middleware …) or does it need a new one?
-   Does the solution need reporting (and should use a reporting logical
    module)?
-   Does it need logging (and should use a logging component)?
-   Does it need security, traceability or audit trail (and should use
    …)?
-   Internationalization?
-   Purge and archiving?
-   To alarm someone or something?
-   To set parameters?
-   An on-line help?
-   To send e-mails?
-   To manage workflows?
-   To manage user-defined classifications, lists, decision tables,
    properties?

Identify and describe the usage dependencies between the logical modules
of the solution and with other logical modules, applications, or
systems. It can be structural links or communication links.

Usage dependencies between in-scope logical modules:

|------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| module1          | module2         | reasons why module1 uses module2 |

You may illustrate these dependencies and using an UML package diagram.

### Applications services

Identify and describe the required and offered services of the logical
modules of the solution.

Application services:

| **Owning module** | **Name**     | **Description**     | **Required/Offered** |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| logical module    | service name | service description |                      |

### Applications flows and interactions

Identify and describe the sent and received application flows between
the logical modules of the solution and with other logical modules of
the IT systems. Identify and describe the interactions between the
in-scope logical modules and services and with other logical modules and
services. You may formalize application flows and i nteractions using
UML interaction diagrams: communication or collaboration diagrams, or
sequence diagrams.

### .Descriptions of the logical modules

Provide here an outline description of the logical modules of the
solution. You may put off in Appendix their complete use cases,
structure (entities and relations) and behavior (object lifecycle)
description. If a logical module is already realized or is a commercial
package to buy, provide here an outline description of its functional
architecture.

other domains? What are the data that could become referential data?
Where could referential data be located? Which referential databases &
nomenclatures are used? Are common referential databases & nomenclatures
used? How or why not? Is it an opportunity to build new referential
databases & nomenclatures that do not exist yet?

### EA Functional Architecture Compliance

Position in the Functional or Services Map:

Position the functional blocks of the solution on the
YOUR ORGANIZATION's Functional or services Map.

-   The YOUR ORGANIZATION's Functional Architecture or Services are is
    often described by an Architecture Model. This model contains
    Functional Blocks that are composed of Functional Domains that are
    composed of Function Groups or Services. All these Functional
    Architecture Elements are laid down on the Functional Map

Functional scope:

-   In the Functional or services Architecture Models, Function or
    services Groups are composed of Macro-functions or macro-services
    which are composed of Functions or services. Functions or services
    are used by Business Architecture's Activities.

-   Identify the functional scope of the Target Solution: find it and
    check the compliance in any Function or Service Catalog containing
    the involved Macro-functions or services.

### IT Risks, in deep

Check all the risks that need to be mitigated in your organization, in
front of classical weaknesses:

-   Integrity:

    -   Corruption of the software used by the Application
    -   Bad design or parameterization of the software
    -   Possible existence of hidden functions introduced during design
        and development stages
    -   Use error
    -   Operating error
    -   Program Error
    -   Bad Configuration Management of programs and software used by
        the Application
    -   Malicious alteration of the data by the network, the internet
        access, …
    -   Viral Infection
    -   Risks due to the external maintenance (risks of modifications of
        the data)

-   Confidentiality

    -   Confidential information gathered in an illicit way (theft or
        photocopy of listings, documents)
    -   Disclosure of confidential information (internal or external)
    -   Possibility of file or programs copy
    -   Appropriation of rights of access (weak passwords)
    -   Duplication or illicit copy of software for the Application
    -   Thefts of laptops or PCs used for the Application
    -   The network (internet or wireless) offers to unauthorized tiers
        the possibility to access to the Application
    -   Application allowing easy exchanges of information (floppy disk,
        messaging, fax, EDM)
    -   Exchanges of information without proof of the origin
    -   Exchanges of information without receipt
    -   Unsafe authentication
    -   Logs not allowing to detect a fraud

-   General risks having a probability to affect the Application

    -   Lack of consistency of the rules emitted for physical security
        on the site (fire, damages of waters, pollution, protection
        against electrical disruption)
    -   Easy intrusion inside the site and in premises, weak access
        controls, indirect accesses
    -   Staff is not aware in computer security, especially in the
        confidentiality of the passwords
    -   Un-mature organization, lacks of displayed directives for
        logical security, charter, code of security, …

-   Resilience

    -   Failure of Technical Component on which the Application will
        work
    -   Serious accident in premises sheltering Technical Components
        being of use by the Application
    -   Technical Components supporting the Application are either
        obsolete or not in progressive configuration
    -   Equipment of the Application are sensitive to the brilliances
        (thermic, electromagnetic)
    -   Technical Components of complex use or little ergonomic
    -   Dysfunction of the telecommunications network on several days
        (saturation, …)
    -   Performances unsuitable during the growth period of the future
        system (response time)
    -   Maintenance of the Technical Components of the Application not
        done (lack of skills)
    -   Risks due to the external maintenance (Technical Components
        failure)
    -   Recovery plan of the application (software and hardware) not
        foreseen

If appropriate, IT Risks may be mitigated in an applicative way, in
which case the mitigation should be expressed.

Business Use-Case cards
=======================

For each business Use-Case you have to provide a clear description (you
can provide an UML use case schema).

In the agile project management cycle you should manage **“stories”** in
order to provide **“software releases”** that encompass **“features”**.

A typical user story looks like : *As a \< type of user \>, I want \<
some goal \> so that \< some reason \>*

**Requirements, UML models, architecture models (like in TOGAF) and
features are related together and often related to stories and
use-cases. But, their descriptions are not always exhaustive and
formalized. At the opposite, stories and use case have a clear semantic
definition.**

Important notice
----------------

Because a use-case is more detailed than a story :

-   some story will be completed by the product owner thrue writing of a
    usecase-card in order to clarify it
-   the development team should update or create all the use-cases
    involved in each new sprint in order to ensure the quality of the
    testing process and the efficiency of the communication between
    product owner and the team members.
-   most of the functional tests are related to use-cases

> Provide one card per use-case

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Use-Case id = \[ \]
----------------------------

\[Name \]

### Brief Description

The description briefly conveys the role and purpose of the business use
case. A single paragraph will suffice for this description.

### Goals

A specification of the measurable goals or objectives of the business
use case.

### Performance Goals

A specification of the metrics relevant to the business use case and a
definition of the goals you want to achieve by using those metrics.
<name of performance goal> A brief description of the performance goal.

### Workflow

A textual description of the workflow the business use case represents.
The workflow describes what the business does to deliver value to a
business actor, not how the business solves its problems. Only one level
of workflow steps is indicated in the subsections below, but you may add
more levels if necessary.

#### Basic Workflow

<names of workflow step> A brief description of the workflow step.

#### Alternative Workflows

<name of workflow step> A brief description of the workflow step.

### Category

Indicate whether the business use case is a ‘core’, ‘supporting’, or
‘management’ category.

### Risk

Specify the risks of executing or implementing the business use case.

### Possibilities

Describe the estimated improvement potential of the business use case.

### Process Owner

Define who the owner of the business process is—this is the person who
manages and plans for the changes.

### Special Requirements

The special requirements of the business use case are included here.
These requirements are not covered by the workflow as it has been
described in the sections above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue / defect management
=========================

An issue/defect management should be in place.

When this form should be used
-----------------------------

If you don’t use any integrated issue manager, or if you want to manage
in deep issues you could use such a form. Such a defect form is not
required if a test tool is used, as the tool enables the management of
defect forms and lists.

This form is a way in which teams can communicate whenever it is
necessary to describe complementary elements for a given defect. It is
not compulsory for all defects.
